# Hybrid\\View

Hybrid View is PHP-based Engine and View package for WordPress themes.  It's used for setting up and rendering theme template files. Views are a bit like a suped-up version of the core WordPress `get_template_part()` function. However, it allows you to build a hierarchy of potential templates as well as pass in any arbitrary data to your templates for use.

## Requirements

* WordPress 4.9+.
* PHP 7.4+ (preferably 8+).
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) for managing PHP dependencies.
